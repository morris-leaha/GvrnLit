# GvrnLit
A mobile-friendly web application designed to eliminate bias and "match" voters to their ideal 2020 presidential candidate.

We believe that everyone should exercise their constitutional right to vote, but we also understand that politics can be overwhelming.  With roughly only 60% of eligible voter turnout for the 2016 presidential election<sup>1</sup> nationwide, GvrnLit hopes to encourage more individuals to vote and to vote with confidence!

In order to eliminate bias, we've designed a short quiz to match users to their ideal 2020 presidential candidate.

Our short quiz has been compiled into 8 categories: 
<ol>
    <li>Crime & Public Safety</li>
    <li>Economy</li>
    <li>Education</li>
    <li>Energy & Environment</li>
    <li>Health Care</li>
    <li>Politics & Political Process</li>
    <li>Recreation & Transportation</li>
    <li>Social Issues</li>
</ol>

Upon completion of the quiz, users will be shown their top 2020 presidential candidate match and match percentage. At this point, users will then have the option to:
* Seek additional information on their top candidate match by providing links to their:
    * Twitter Account
    * Personal Website
    * Recent News
    * Instagram Account
* Compare quiz answers, side by side, to their top candidate match
* View ALL potential 2020 presidential candidates with the aforementioned links, to gain even more information.

Should users decide to save their results, users will be asked to create an account/sign in to their account.

Account holders will then have the ability to gain even more knowledge by having the ability to:
* See other possible candidate matches and corresponding match percentage
* Compare quiz questions, side by side, to ALL candidates
* Retake the quiz and save each quiz result
* See ways to get involved
