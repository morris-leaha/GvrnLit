# GvrnLit
A mobile-friendly web application designed to eliminate bias and "match" voters to their perfect 2020 presidential candidate.

We believe that everyone should exercise their constitutional right to vote, but we also understand that politics can be overwhelming.  With only roughly 60% of eligible voter turnout for the 2016 presidential election, GvrnLit hopes to encourage more individuals to vote and to vote with confidence!
